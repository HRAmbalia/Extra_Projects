# My Random Projects Repository

Welcome to my collection of random projects! This repository contains various projects I've worked on, ranging from web development with Django to machine learning with IBM Watson, core Java applications, and Python scripting. Each project showcases different skills and concepts.

## Projects

### 1. Movie Rental System (Django)
This project is a movie rental system built with Django. It allows staff members to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on movie data. The key features include:

- Adding new movies to the database.
- Updating existing movie details.
- Deleting movies from the database.
- Viewing a list of all available movies.

**Technologies Used:**
- Django
- SQLite (default Django database)

### 2. IBM Watson ML Model Deployment
In this project, I created a machine learning model using IBM Watson. The model was trained on CSV data and then deployed to make it live.  This project demonstrates the following:

- Presenting the CSV data.
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Training a machine learning model.
- Deploying the model using IBM Watson services.

**Technologies Used:**
- IBM Watson
- Python

### 3. Library Management System (Core Java)
This is a library management system implemented in Java. The system utilizes many core Java concepts, including:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**
- **Inheritance**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Collections Framework**
- **Exception Handling**
- **File I/O**
- **Constructors**

The system supports functionalities like adding books, borrowing books, returning books, and generating reports on the borrowed books and users.

**Technologies Used:**
- Java (OOPS)

### 4. YouTube to MP3 Converter (Python)
This mini project is a Python script that converts YouTube videos to MP3 format and downloads them. It showcases:

- Fetching YouTube video data.
- Converting video to MP3 format.
- Downloading the MP3 file locally.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- `pytube` library for YouTube video handling
- `moviepy` library for video conversion
- `tkinter` library for ui
