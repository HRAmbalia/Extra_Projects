## Projects

### Movie Rental System (Django)
This project is a movie rental system built with Django. It allows staff members to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on movie data. The key features include:

- Adding new movies to the database.
- Updating existing movie details.
- Deleting movies from the database.
- Viewing a list of all available movies.

**Technologies Used:**
- Django
- SQLite (default Django database)

### IBM Watson ML Model Deployment
In this project, I created a machine learning model using IBM Watson. The model was trained on CSV data and then deployed to make it live. This project demonstrates the following:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Training a machine learning model.
- Deploying the model using IBM Watson services.

**Technologies Used:**
- IBM Watson
- Python
- Pandas (for CSV data handling)

### Library Management System (Core Java)
This is a library management system implemented in Java. The system utilizes many core Java concepts, including:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**
- **Inheritance**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Collections Framework**
- **Exception Handling**
- **File I/O**
- **Constructors**

The system supports functionalities like adding books, borrowing books, returning books, and generating reports on the borrowed books and users.

**Technologies Used:**
- Java

### YouTube to MP3 Converter (Python)
This mini project is a Python script that converts YouTube videos to MP3 format and downloads them. It showcases:

- Fetching YouTube video data.
- Converting video to MP3 format.
- Downloading the MP3 file locally.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- `pytube` library for YouTube video handling
- `moviepy` library for video conversion
- `tkinter` library for UI
